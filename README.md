# minecraft-operator

This repo originally contained a kubernetes operator for managing minecraft servers.
It was a pet project for practice writing operators while also adding a little bit of value in my personal life.

I need to do better market research, because the ecosystem has improved greatly since I first had the idea.
[Shulkers](https://github.com/jeremylvln/Shulker) builds on top of [Agones](https://github.com/googleforgames/agones) and both seem to be very well supported.

There is no end of GUI Minecraft installer tools, but not quite as many that support Kubernetes.
I figure I can do less wheel re-inventing by building a tool to fill that role.
I'll be working on that over at <https://github.com/UnstoppableMango/minecraft-manager> for as long as it is my hyperfocus.
